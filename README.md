# [Invite the bot to your server!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=909114894601830400&permissions=1403679534199&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
* Use the above link if you don't want to follow the steps bellow.
### Requirements for the self hosting
* node.js
* Windows Build tools 2017
* Basic knowledge of using cd in a command prompt

If you know how this stuff works you can just download this project directly and install the modules yourself.
Installing everything yourself may be better in terms of keeping modules up to date.
# **Installation guide**
* You can now download the bot from the release page so you can follow this setup guide easier.
* New bat files have been made so you can install modules easier.
## Getting your credentials:
* Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
* Make a new application.
* Go to the bot tab and then click add bot.
### Token and create config file:
Your token is what you use to log the bot in.
* Create a "**config.json**" file with properties ‚¨áÔ∏è (**Must be on main folder** | **Not needed if you downloaded the release**)
* On the bot tab click copy where it says token.
* Once you have coppied the token you may now paste it into the config file.
* **MAKE SURE YOU PASTE IT BETWEEN THE SPEECH MARKS.**
 ### Your discord ID
 * To get the ID go to discords settings and go to the "**Appearance**".
 * Once you are on the Appearance tab, scroll down until you find "**Developer Mode**".
 * Turn on "**Developer Mode**"
 * Now that Developer Mode is on type a message on any server then right click on your name then click coppy id.
 * Paste the coppied ID into the "**ownerID**" section of your config.(**Optional**)
 * Paste the coppied channel ID into the "**errLogChannelID**" section of your config.(**Optional**)
 
 * If you followed the stepts correctly the config.json file should now look like this:
  ```js 
  {
  "token": "Your discord token",
  "prefix": "Your prefix",
  "ownerID": "Your discord id",
  "errLogChannelID": "Your channel id"
   }
  ```
  * You may now save the config and move to the installation process.
## How to install:
1. Install node.js at https://nodejs.org
2. Double click the **npm-install.bat** file and wait for everything to install.(**Not needed if you downloaded the release**)
3. Once everything has installed run **start.bat** .
4. Wait for everything to load and the bot should now be up and running.

## Adding the bot to your server:
1. Go back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and click on your application.
2. Go to the **General Information** tab and you should see your client ID.
3. Click copy.
4. Now that you have your client ID go to this website [Discord Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#268561526)
5. Paste your client ID into where it says **Client ID** then select the permissions you want.
6. Once you have finished doing that click the invite link that the website generated and it should take you to your bots invite page.
7. Invite the bot to your server.
8. Test the bot to see if it works by typing k!ping and if the command works then you have completed all the steps correctly.

***If you want to constantly invite the bot to servers keep the link that the permission calculator generated saved somewhere***
# Well Done!
You now have a self hosted working bot on your server!
# Self Hosting: (optional)
If you want more reliable hosting without having it run on your main pc or on your home network, I recommend buying a web server.
The bot can be ran on Windows.
